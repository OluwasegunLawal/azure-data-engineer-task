# Azure Data Engineer Task for Sumitomo Corporation

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering pipeline using Python and Azure SQL.
It covers ingestion, transformation, storage, and orchestration, following real-world data engineering practices.

The pipeline ingests product data from a public API, cleans and enriches it, and loads it into an Azure SQL database.
This project implements an end-to-end data engineering pipeline that:
1. Fetches product data from an external API  
2. Transforms and cleans the data
3. Loads curated data into Azure SQL Database

The pipeline is designed to be repeatable and idempotent.

---

## Architecture
**Extract → Transform → Load (ETL)**

- **Extract**: Python script pulls raw JSON from FakeStore API
- **Transform**: Cleans, enriches, and normalizes product data
- **Load**: Inserts data into Azure SQL Database using `MERGE`

---

## Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Azure SQL Database
- pyodbc
- REST API
- Git / GitHub

---

## Project Structure
Note that, before the data ingestion, I created a resource group in azure for this project and created the following resources:
-storage account, in which i created the bronze and silver containere
-sql server
-sql database which is my landing place for the transformed data


Pipeline Steps--more breakdown
1. Ingest (raw/bromze)

Fetches product data from FakeStore API

Saves raw JSON files locally with timestamps (fetch_data.py)

2. Transform (processed/silver)

Cleans and normalizes data

Converts prices from USD to GBP

Adds metadata (processed timestamp, source file)    all these can be found in the transform_data.py script in my repo

3. Load

Loads data into Azure SQL   (you can find this in my load_to_sql.py script)

Uses idempotent logic (MERGE)

Creates table automatically if not present

4. Orchestrate    (python code found in run_pipeline.py)

Pipeline order: fetch → transform → load

Orchestration implemented using:

run_pipeline.py (local simulation)

Airflow DAG: Airflow DAG is provided for production orchestration; run_pipeline.py simulates daily execution locally (product_pipeline_dag.py)
